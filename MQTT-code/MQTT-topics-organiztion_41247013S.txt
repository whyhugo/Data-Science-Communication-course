# MQTT Topics Organization for Taipei Metro Emergency Radar Project

> NTNU 41247013S 王修佑 Hugo Wang

## Overview
In addition to sensor data, the project allows passengers to send their GPS location during an emergency. The MQTT topics are structured to handle both sensor data and user-reported GPS locations.

## Topic Structure
The MQTT topics are organized hierarchically as follows:
- **sensor**: For sensor-related data.
- **gps**: For GPS location data from passengers.
- **location/parameterType**: Specifies the location and type of data.

## Example Topics
- **sensor/headCount/stationA**:
  - For headcount sensors at Station A.
- **sensor/smoke/stationB**:
  - For smoke detectors at Station B.
- **gps/emergency/userID**:
  - For GPS data from users during an emergency. The `userID` can be a unique identifier for the passenger or device.

## Usage Scenario
- In an emergency, passengers can send their GPS location using the topic **gps/emergency/userID**. The data can include latitude, longitude, and possibly a timestamp.
- This information can be used by emergency responders to locate individuals in need of assistance within the Taipei Metro system.

## Future Expansion
- **sensor/fire/stationC**: For fire detection systems in Station C.
- **gps/nonEmergency/userID**: For non-emergency location sharing, if needed.

This structure ensures that both sensor data and user-reported GPS locations are efficiently managed and monitored, enhancing the overall emergency response system in the Taipei Metro.
